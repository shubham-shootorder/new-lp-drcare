                  blood for a prolonged period of time can lead to many
                  complications like diabetic retinopathy causing vision
                  disturbances, diabetic nephropathy or kidney problems,
                  diabetic neuropathy affecting nerves which can lead to
                  problems like burning sensation or loss of sensation, feeling
                  of imbalance, ejaculation disorders in males, urinary
                  incontinence etc. Diabetes is also the major risk factor for
                  hypertension, atherosclerosis and heart disorders. Frequent
                  infections, poor healing of wounds, non healing ulcers are
                  also other complications of diabetes.

                  Besides these symptoms the increased concentration of sugar in
                  blood for a prolonged period of time can lead to many
                  complications like diabetic retinopathy causing vision
                  disturbances, diabetic nephropathy or kidney problems,
                  diabetic neuropathy affecting nerves which can lead to
                  problems like burning sensation or loss of sensation, feeling
                  of imbalance, ejaculation disorders in males, urinary
                  incontinence etc. Diabetes is also the major risk factor for
                  hypertension, atherosclerosis and heart disorders. Frequent
                  infections, poor healing of wounds, non healing ulcers are
                  also other complications of diabetes.
